=========================

Repository of my analysis on tracepoints currently in the Linux kernel

How static tracepoints are add to the Linux Kernel?
~~~sh

/*
 * Tracepoint for task switches, performed by the scheduler:
 */
TRACE_EVENT(sched_switch,

	TP_PROTO(struct task_struct *prev,
		 struct task_struct *next),

	TP_ARGS(prev, next),

	TP_STRUCT__entry(
		__array(	char,	prev_comm,	TASK_COMM_LEN	)
		__field(	pid_t,	prev_pid			)
		__field(	int,	prev_prio			)
		__field(	long,	prev_state			)
		__array(	char,	next_comm,	TASK_COMM_LEN	)
		__field(	pid_t,	next_pid			)
		__field(	int,	next_prio			)
	),

	TP_fast_assign(
		memcpy(__entry->next_comm, next->comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
		__entry->prev_pid	= prev->pid;
		__entry->prev_prio	= prev->prio;
		__entry->prev_state	= __trace_sched_switch_state(prev);
		memcpy(__entry->prev_comm, prev->comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
		__entry->next_pid	= next->pid;
		__entry->next_prio	= next->prio;
	),

	TP_printk("prev_comm=%s prev_pid=%d prev_prio=%d prev_state=%s%s ==> next_comm=%s next_pid=%d next_prio=%d",
		__entry->prev_comm, __entry->prev_pid, __entry->prev_prio,
		__entry->prev_state & (TASK_STATE_MAX-1) ?
		  __print_flags(__entry->prev_state & (TASK_STATE_MAX-1), "|",
				{ 1, "S"} , { 2, "D" }, { 4, "T" }, { 8, "t" },
				{ 16, "Z" }, { 32, "X" }, { 64, "x" },
				{ 128, "W" }) : "R",
		__entry->prev_state & TASK_STATE_MAX ? "+" : "",
		__entry->next_comm, __entry->next_pid, __entry->next_prio)
);

Once upon a time there was a Linux Kernel tracing suite called LTTng that was creating its own patch to add tracepoints in the kernel.
The first part of the analysis was to find what were the tracepoint alrgi
